# SEO & Best Practices Guide: OnePlatform

## Overview
OnePlatform is a modern, potentially SaaS-ready platform built with Angular 20+, Nx (Nrwl), and a feature-sliced, domain-driven design (DDD) architecture. This guide outlines SEO strategies and best practices for scalable, interactive, and high-performing web applications.

## Meta Tags & Head Elements
- Use descriptive `<title>`, `<meta name="description">`, and `<meta name="robots">` for every page.
- Add Open Graph and Twitter Card tags for social sharing.
- Set canonical URLs to avoid duplicate content.
- Use structured data (JSON-LD) for products, organization, and breadcrumbs.

## Feature-Sliced & DDD Architecture
- Organize code by domain and feature (feature-sliced, Nx workspace libs/apps).
- Use clear boundaries for UI, domain, and infrastructure layers.
- Enable scalability and maintainability for SaaS and multi-tenant scenarios.

## UI/UX & Material Design
- Use Angular Material for consistent, accessible UI components.
- Follow Material Design guidelines for color, spacing, and interaction.
- Ensure all interactive elements are accessible (ARIA, keyboard navigation).

## Interactive & Responsive Design
- Implement responsive layouts (Flexbox, CSS Grid, Angular CDK Layout).
- Optimize for mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- Use interactive design patterns (animations, feedback, micro-interactions).

## Internationalization (i18n)
- Support multiple languages using Angular i18n or ngx-translate.
- Set the correct `lang` attribute in `<html>`.
- Provide translation files for all user-facing text.

## Multi-Tenancy
- Architect for multiple tenants: isolated data, theming, and configuration.
- Use environment variables and Nx configuration for tenant-specific builds.

## Authentication & Payments
- Implement secure login, registration, and payment flows.
- Use OAuth2, OpenID Connect, or similar standards.
- Ensure all sensitive data is handled securely (HTTPS, JWT, etc.).

## Testing & Quality
- Use Test-Driven Development (TDD) for all features.
- Write unit tests (Jest) and end-to-end tests (Playwright).
- Mock data and services for isolated testing.
- Maintain high code coverage and test reliability.

## CI/CD & Automation
- Use GitHub Actions and/or GitLab CI for automated builds, tests, and deployments.
- Enforce code quality checks (linting, formatting, type checks) in CI.
- Automate deployment to staging/production environments.

## Performance & Lighthouse
- Optimize images, fonts, and assets for fast loading.
- Use server-side rendering (SSR) or prerendering for SEO and performance.
- Minimize and bundle CSS/JS.
- Regularly audit with Google Lighthouse; aim for scores 90+ in all categories.
